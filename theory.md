## Theory 
### 1. Reactions of amides:
 
- **Reaction of NaOH:**

Amides are decomposed by NaOH to evolve ammonia. The gas can be tested by a moist red litmus paper which is then turned blue.

</div>

- **Alkaline hydrolysis of aromatic amides to aromatic acid:**
 

The soluble sodium salt of aromatic acid formed from aromatic amides upon hydrolysis is regenerated as white precipitate in acidic medium.

</div>


- **Biuret Reaction for aliphatic diamide:**
 

When aliphatic diamide is heated at a temperature above its melting point, ammonia is evolved and crystalline biuret is formed. This biuret in alkaline medium gives a violet colour with a drop of copper sulphate solution.

</div>

- **Hydroxamic acid test for aromatic primary amides:**
 

Hydrogen peroxide reacts with aromatic primary amides to form the hydroxamic acid, which then reacts with ferric chloride to form ferric hydroxamate complex having a violet colour.

</div>

- **Fluorescein Reaction:**
 

The anhydrides of aromatic 1,2-dicarboxylic acids on heating with resorcinol gives a dye fluorescein. This dye in NaOH solution gives a yellowish red solution with green fluorescence. 

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>


### 3. Reactions of phenols:
 

- **Reaction of neutral ferric chloride solution:**
 

Phenol form characteristic coloured iron complexes when treated with neutral ferric chloride solution. E.g. phenol & resorcinol - violet colour, catechol-green etc.

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

- **Azo dye formation:**
 

Aryldiazonium salts react with aromatic rings of phenols to form highly coloured azo compounds. These reactions are called coupling reactions.

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>

- **Benzoylation:**
 

Phenols react with benzoyl chloride in presence of NaOH, to form esters.

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>


### 4. Reactions of primary amines:
 

- **Diazotisation:**
 

At low temperature (0-5oC) aromatic primary amines dissolved in strong acids (HCl & H2SO4) reacts with nitrous acid (NaNO2 +HCl) to form water soluble diazonium salts. 

Aliphatic primary amines do not form stable diazonium salts under similar condition. They react with nitrous acid to yield alcohols and nitrogen (causes rapid foaming).

- **Azo dye formation for aromatic primary amines:**
 

Aryldiazonium salts react with aromatic rings of phenols to form highly coloured azo compounds. These reactions are called **coupling reactions**.

</div>

- **Benzoylation:**
 

Primary aromatic amines react with benzoyl chloride in presence of NaOH, replacing the H atom attached to the N atom with the benzoyl group to give anilides.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/517e310b-b15c-4c88-a064-ab87e967f7dd" alt="1456300104_eq 1" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
</div>

- **Hinsberg reaction:**
 

Hinsberg reagent is called benzenesulfonyl chloride. Primary aliphatic amines on reaction with benzenesulfonyl chloride & NaOH gives N-alkylsulphonamide which contains an acidic hydrogen and hence dissolve in NaOH solution to form the soluble sodium salt. The solution thus obtained on acidification gives a precipitate of free sulfonamide which is insoluble in HCl.

</div>

Action of sodium nitroprusside solution:

 

The nitroprusside ion, which may be regarded as a special carrier of the nitrosonium ion, forms a coloured complex with methyl ketones. In presence of alkali eg acetone is converted to CH3COCH2- ion which reacts with nitroprusside ion $[Fe(CN)_5NO]^{2-}$ to give highly coloured ion $[Fe(CN)_5NOCH_2COCH_3]^{2-}$.
